SoftI2CMaster is an Arduino library that implements
a simple "bit-bang" software-only I2C (aka "TWI") Master.

This lets you use any two Arduino pins to be the SDA & SCL 
pins needed to communicate with I2C devices like BlinkMs.

SoftI2CMaster was originally in the BlinkMSoftI2CDemo example
in http://code.google.com/p/blinkm-projects/
